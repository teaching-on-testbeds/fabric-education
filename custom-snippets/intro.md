::: {.cell .markdown}

In this notebook you will:

* Reserve resources for this experiment
* Configure your reserved resources
* Access your reserved resources over SSH
* Extend your FABRIC reservation (in case you need more time) or delete it (in case you finish early)

And, after using the resources to [execute an experiment related to TCP congestion control](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/tcp-congestion-control-basics/):

* Retrieve files saved on a FABRIC resource
* Visualize the data retrieved

**Prerequisites**: This material assumes you have already configured your FABRIC account following the instructions in [Hello, FABRIC](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/hello-fabric/).
