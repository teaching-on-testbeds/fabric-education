::: {.cell .markdown}

In this notebook you will:

* Reserve resources for this experiment
* Configure your reserved resources
* Access your reserved resources over SSH
* Extend your FABRIC reservation (in case you need more time) or delete it (in case you finish early)

Then, you will use the resources to [execute an experiment related to an Ethernet switch or bridge](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/).

**Prerequisites**: This material assumes you have already configured your FABRIC account following the instructions in [Hello, FABRIC](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/hello-fabric/).
