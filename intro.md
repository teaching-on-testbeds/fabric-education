# Network layer security 

:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

The exercises in this experiment will focus on security services offered at the **network layer** of the TCP/IP protocol stack. You will configure a network with a VPN tunnel, and then you will examine the extent to which you are protected from unauthorized eavesdroppers on network traffic, when you use a file transfer application (with and without [application layer confidentiality](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/secure-networked-applications/)).

It should take about 60 minutes to run this experiment.
