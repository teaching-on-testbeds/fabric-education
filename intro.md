::: {.cell .markdown}

In this experimental demonstration of the TCP/IP protocol architecture, we will examine network addresses and connections at

* the network access (a.k.a. data link) layer,
* the Internet (IP) layer,
* the transport layer (logical host-to-host), and
* the application layer.

It should take about 60 minutes to run this experiment.
